****The 5 R framework for writing****

**Research**

Before you sit down to write, you research the subject you want to write about. While ideating for this issue, I went over the 4-5 books on writing that I have read.

As a part of the research for your writing, read good-authority articles, books, videos and podcasts.

**Reflect**

Most of you directly jump to writing after performing the necessary research. You shouldn't. Let me tell you why.

In research, you collect the thoughts of different people. If you write just after doing your research, you will write only about their thoughts, not your own. Remember that the audience will mainly read your article because of your credibility. Show them your views and your ideas.

Connect the information that you have collected. What makes sense? What doesn't? Those points are coherent. Those are contradictory.

Build a mind map (on paper) of what you want to present in your article and how.

**Record**

This is where Otter comes to the rescue. You can record your content, and then use the transcribed notes when you finally start writing.

**Render**

I say render, and not write because you will type (or render) the content in a document. (And also because the word "render" starts with an R and fits in.) This is where you finally put your thoughts down in a document and write your piece.

**Review**

Get rid of 20-30% of the content while editing. Remove all the clutter. Good writing is lean and confident.
