## Software architecture is about decisions, not structure

Knowing why someone did something is just as important as knowing what they did.

The reason for this is that architectural decisions in software are rarely clear-cut; nearly every architectural decision is a compromise between competing alternatives, and the merit of alternatives is hard to see until you try a few and see how they work

Knowing what was tried and rejected is often more useful than knowing what worked

good judgment comes from experience, most of which comes from bad judgment.

So what kind of skills do people need to develop to improve the quality of their architectural work?

→ An increased focus on quality attributes, which are the key cross-cutting requirements that good architecture should address. 

→ An ability to conceptualize and address system-wide concerns

→ An ability to balance concerns and compromise. There is rarely one right answer in architecture work.

→An ability to learn from experience and synthesize new approaches

→ The ability to raise concerns, foster discussion of different perspectives, and facilitate consensus helps a team confront and overcome complex architectural problems
