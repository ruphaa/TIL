### The Super mario effect

Approach everything like Mario game - Focus on the princess than the pits, learn from your failures and keep moving forward.

By reframing the learning process and focussing on the cool end goal, the fear of failure is often taken off the table and learning just comes more naturally.

What if instead of performing, doing, we spend more time exploring, listening, experimenting, reflecting, striving and becoming?

- the learning zone and the performance zone
